ePICS is a Ruby on Rails application developed by Baobab Health Trust for the managing of pharmacy inventory.

== Getting Started

To use the ePICS application, you first need to download the application from the github repository to your computer.
This can be achieved by running the following command in linux:

    git clone  https://github.com/BaobabHealthTrust/ePICS.git

Now that you have the application on you computer, the following steps will help you get the application running

1. Set up the gems utilised by the ePICS application. These are bundled together with the application and can be installed
   by running the following command: bundle install --local


2. copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml

3. set up database details in config/database.yml. You will require two databases. A custom ePICS database whose details
 you can type under Development or Production environment database settings and an OpenMRS database whose details will
 be under openmrs.

4. Create the ePICS database. This is done by running rake db:create db:migrate

5. Load initial data for items into the database by running rake db:seed

After carrying out these steps, your application is now ready to be used.
